# BrTube
Open source, simplistic YouTube video viewer/downloader/unblocker. Nothing is proxied through a server, so video speeds aren't affected.

## To-Do:
- Convert YouTube shorts links to regular YouTube links
- Add feeds (useful for the player's right side)
- **Make a full-fledged web client, with feeds and support for watching YouTube shorts**
